In progress chess bot from scratch  
Will likely take weeks to make, months to make good, and years to make excellent :)

Goal is to be ~ National Master strength by fall 2025

Plan of progression:
1) Working board representation (can display position and move between positions) [Done in 1.0.0]
2) Working move generation (can generate all legal moves in the position) [Done in 1.0.0]
3) Working chess bot (can make moves that at least do not hang material right away)\ [Done in 1.0.0, using eval function from mini-bot project]
4) Efficient board representation & move generation (bitboards? make this part fast and smooth) [Intial improvements (proper use of bitboard, magic bitboards) in 1.1.0] 
5) More effective and efficient bot algorithm (two options - search & eval/AI) [Transposition tables and stored move ordering in 1.1.0]
6) Loop & improve 4, 5a, 5b until desired strength is reached! - To get to Byte 2.0, I would like to overhaul evaluation, fix some small bugs, and improve some changes from 1.1.0
