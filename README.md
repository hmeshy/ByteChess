In progress chess bot from scratch  
Will likely take weeks to make, months to make good, and years to make excellent :)

Goal is to be ~ National Master strength by fall 2025

Plan of progression:
1) Working board representation (can display position and move between positions) [IN PROGRESS}
2) Working move generation (can generate all legal moves in the position)
3) Working chess bot (can make moves that at least do not hang material right away)\
4) Efficient board representation & move generation (bitboards? make this part fast and smooth)
5) More effective and efficient bot algorithm (two options - search & eval/AI)
6) Loop & improve 4, 5a, 5b until desired strength is reached!
